# CS4800-Project
This is our CS4800 Software Engineering project.
We had to make a web service (basically a website with api backend).
We chose to use Java with Spring Boot, MongoDB, JWT, and a few other libraries.
We utilized the DAO pattern due to not knowing if MongoDB would be the right choice.
